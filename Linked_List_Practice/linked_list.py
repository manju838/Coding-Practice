Constructors are generally used for instantiating an object.
The task of constructors is to initialize(assign values) to the data members of the class when an object of the class is created. 
In Python the __init__() method is called the constructor and is always called when an object is created.

Constructors are either default constructor(doesnâ€™t accept arguments, only argument is the reference to the instance(denoted by self)) or parameterised constructor(accepts programmer 
defined parameters in addition to instance reference(self))
